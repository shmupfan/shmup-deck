# Changelog

Every release of Shmup Deck, newest first. The GitHub release for each version carries the same notes at greater length. `tools/release.sh` reads the notes for a release from this file, so a version cannot be published without an entry here.

## 1.12.6 (2026-10-04)

- On an iPad mini in portrait, or an iPad in Split View, the wall shows three columns of cards instead of two very large ones.
- On large screens the wall grows with the window: six columns on a 1920 monitor and eight on a 2560 one, where it used to stop at four.
- On a touch screen, tapping a card no longer leaves it raised. Cards still lift under a mouse or trackpad.

## 1.12.5 (2026-10-03)

- Two games on kyledlester's new cores: Nostradamus (Face, 1993) with its Japan and Korea sets, and Nebulas Ray (Namco, 1994) with its Japan set. Both cores are betas outside Update All, so these cards appear once the core is installed. Nebulas Ray also needs namcoc75.zip (issue #11).
- Nebulas Ray joins the Namco deck.

## 1.12.4 (2026-10-01)

- Card-shaped flyers for Aero Fighters and Hyper Duel: the Video System flyer, and the Japanese cover in place of the text page. Only these two download.

## 1.12.3 (2026-10-01)

- New MRAs are found without a rescan. Whether they come from Update All, are copied over the network or are installed by hand, the game shows as ready the next time the deck or the ROMs page opens. Before, the deck only knew the MRAs that were on the card when it was installed (issue #10).
- MRAs edited on a PC are picked up when the MiSTer next starts.
- The ROMs page names the set an MRA needs, such as "an MRA for set hyprduel", instead of "the MRA". MRAs are matched on the set name inside them, whatever the file is called.
- The ROMs page has a Rescan the SD card button, for an MRA replaced with a new version under the same name.
- New games' flyers download first, and a flyer is downloaded again only when its art changes, so an update no longer downloads every flyer again. Until a flyer is on the MiSTer, the deck shows it straight from the flyer mirror.
- The deck and the ROMs page load faster on a MiSTer with a full cores folder.

## 1.12.2 (2026-09-30)

- Gyruss is gone: it is a tube shooter rather than a scrolling one, and the deck keeps to scrolling shooters. The Konami tate deck now has nine games.

## 1.12.1 (2026-09-30)

- Eight new shared decks: Early scrollers, Namco, Jaleco, Kaneko boards, Aero Fighters, Taito, Capcom and TwinBee.
- Twinkle Star Sprites joins the Neo Geo deck. The Toaplan deck adds Twin Hawk, Dogyuun, FixEight and Grind Stormer, and Konami tate adds Scramble, Super Cobra, MX5000, Lightning Fighters and Detana!! TwinBee.
- Burning Force is gone: it is a 3D rail shooter, and the deck keeps to scrolling shooters.
- Card-shaped flyers for Future Spy, Gun & Frontier, Turbo Force and Zaxxon.

## 1.12.0 (2026-09-30)

- 76 more shooters, 296 in all. Every forced-scrolling shooter with a MiSTer core is now in the deck, with its regional sets. Among them: Hyper Duel, Twinkle Star Sprites, Xexex, Detana!! TwinBee, Thunder Force AC, Aero Fighters, Turbo Force, Gun & Frontier, Mega Blast, Thunder Cross II, Lightning Fighters, P-47, Saint Dragon, E.D.F., Cybattler, Prehistoric Isle in 1930, Vapor Trail, Boogie Wings, Sol Divide, Mazinger Z, Master of Weapon, Last Duel, Gun.Smoke, 1943 Kai, Cotton, Sonic Boom, Zaxxon, Scramble, Super Cobra, Star Force, Super Xevious and Star Soldier: Vanishing Earth.
- Games on the official, JOTEGO and Coin-Op Collection cores show as usual. Games on cores outside Update All (kuzearcade, Mezzow, alphanu1, jlrh, Slop-Core and the MiSTer_Ongo database) appear once the core is installed.
- A card now recognises a core under the other names collections ship it as, so E.D.F. is found whether its core came from kuzearcade or from MiSTer_Ongo.
- Flyers for 71 of the new games. Landscape flyers and ones shaped differently from a card are shown whole.

## 1.11.3 (2026-09-30)

- Seven Dooyong shooters on the new Dooyong core: The Last Day, Gulf Storm, Pollux, Flying Tiger, Blue Hawk, Super-X and R-Shark, with their regional sets (Chulgyeok D-Day and the rest). The core is outside Update All (github.com/searchsolved/Arcade-Dooyong_MiSTer), so these cards appear once it is installed.

## 1.11.2 (2026-09-27)

- Four Namco System 2 shooters on kuzearcade's new core: Ordyne, Phelios, Burning Force and Dragon Saber, with their regional sets. The core is in development and outside Update All, so these cards appear once it is installed. Every game also needs namcoc65.zip.

## 1.11.1 (2026-09-27)

- Four more games on ppriest's new Konami GX core: Fantastic Journey (Gokujou Parodius), Twin Bee Yahhoo! (Magical Twin Bee), Salamander 2 and Sexy Parodius, with their regional sets. The core is a work-in-progress beta outside Update All, so these cards appear once it is installed. Every game also needs konamigx.zip.
- RayStorm now finds its regional sets (Ver 2.05O, 2.05A and 2.05J).

## 1.11.0 (2026-09-24)

- New display font: the title, headings, deck names and Now playing use Press Start 2P, bundled with the app so it works offline and looks the same on every phone.
- Back to menu is now optional and off by default. Switch it on in Settings under Games; the choice is kept per device.

## 1.10.3 (2026-09-21)

- Five more games: Air Gallet, Darius, Darius II, Dogyuun and Grind Stormer, with their regional sets (Akuu Gallet, V-Five and the rest). From #8.
- Air Gallet runs on the CaveBanpresto core in the main distribution. Darius and Darius II use rmonic79's cores; Dogyuun and Grind Stormer use TheJesusFish's Slop-Core. Games on cores outside Update All appear once the core is installed.
- Batsugun's core link now points to Slop-Core, which has the core build.

## 1.10.2 (2026-09-21)

- Regional sets: 74 more set names on 39 cards, so a Japanese version with a different title is found and launched. Area 88 under U.N. Squadron, U.S. Navy under Carrier Air Wing, Lost Worlds under Forgotten Worlds, Sengoku Ace under Samurai Aces and so on. Fixes the rest of #7.
- Now playing names the set that loaded when it is not the card's first one, so Gradius II shows as such under the Vulcan Venture card.
- Region reads the short forms organised sets use, such as JP, W and EU.
- Back to menu: a button on the Now playing banner and the full-screen flyer loads the MiSTer's own menu, the same as the User button on the board.

## 1.10.1 (2026-09-20)

- The version picker has a Cancel button and a dimmed background, so closing it never launches the card underneath.
- The Layout choices in Settings share the control evenly.
- Standard app wording across Settings, the Decks page and the footers.

## 1.10.0 (2026-09-20)

- Region setting: Any, Japan, World, USA, Europe or Asia. The wall shows games with a set from that region and launches that set. Kept on the MiSTer, so every phone sees the same choice.
- Made for you: automatic decks on the Decks page. Most played, not played yet, tonight's ten, and games hidden by your screen filter.
- Share with everyone: a deck of yours can be offered to the community as a pull request on GitHub. A workflow checks each one.
- Twelve shared decks, reworded and in release order, including a Raizing deck.
- Favourites removed. An old favourites list becomes an ordinary deck called Favourites on first start.
