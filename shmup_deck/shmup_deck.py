"""Shmup Deck service for the MiSTer.

Serves the deck web app and launches games itself, so nothing else (mrext
Remote, a PC, a hosted site) is needed. The page and the API share one origin,
which avoids the mixed-content and CORS problems of hosting the app elsewhere.

Games are matched by MAME setname, read from inside each .mra, never guessed
from filenames. That is what separates Gunbird from Gunbird 2 and DonPachi from
DoDonPachi.

Flyer art is not shipped. On first start the service downloads each flyer
from the sources pinned in app/art.json and keeps it on the SD card.

    python3 shmup_deck.py [--port 8190]

Python 3.9 standard library only, which is what the MiSTer image ships.
