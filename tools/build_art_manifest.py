"""Build shmup_deck/app/art.json from downloaded flyer scans.

For each game this records where its flyer is downloaded from and which
rectangle of the scan to show on the card: the scan minus the blank paper the
scanner caught around it. Nothing printed is cropped. The recorded scan size
lets the app notice if a source ever serves a different image, and show that
one whole rather than applying a crop meant for another scan.

    python3 tools/build_art_manifest.py sources.json scans/

sources.json maps game id to {"url": ..., "referer": optional}. scans/ holds
<id>.img files downloaded from exactly those URLs. The scans themselves are
never committed; only the numbers derived from them are.
