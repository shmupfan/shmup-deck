"""Check every card lists all of its game's MAME sets.

    python3 tools/check_sets.py [--fix]

A card matches MRAs by set name, so a Japanese version with its own title
(Area 88 under U.N. Squadron, U.S. Navy under Carrier Air Wing) is only
found if its set name is on the card. MAME's driver source is the reference:
every GAME line names a set and its parent. For each card this lists the
parent's clones that no card carries, leaving out hacks, bootlegs and
prototypes (and internal builds, MAME's name for a development
version), sets that turn the monitor the other way from the card (a
horizontal Red Hawk under the tate Stagger I), and anything in SKIP. --fix
appends them to the card.

Shares the driver cache with check_orientation.py.
