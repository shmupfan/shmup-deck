# Supported games and ROMs

Shmup Deck supports 317 games: 302 arcade games that run from MRA files and 15 Neo Geo games. This page lists the core and ROM files each one needs.

To see what your own MiSTer is missing, open **http://shmupdeck.local/check.html** once Shmup Deck is installed. It checks every game for its MRA, core and ROM zips and can copy the missing zip names.

Shmup Deck contains no ROMs, MRAs or cores.

## Reading the tables

- ROM zips go in `games/mame` on the SD card or a USB drive.
- **Zip** is the file from a non-merged or split MAME set.
- **Merged set zip** is where a merged set keeps the same game. Clones live inside their parent's zip, so it differs only for clones. A split set needs both.
- **Also needs** lists BIOS and chip ROM zips shared between games. These are needed whichever kind of set you use.
- Each MRA is written against a particular MAME version, stated in its `<mameversion>` tag. A recent MAME set suits most games; if one won't start, compare your set's version with that tag.

## Cores

| Source | How to get it |
| --- | --- |
| MiSTer main distribution | Installed by update_all by default |
| JOTEGO cores | Optional database; switch it on in update_all's settings |
| Coin-Op Collection | Optional database; switch it on in update_all's settings |
| MeatCores | Not distributed through Update All; the deck lists these games only when the core is already installed |

These cores are not in update_all. Install the core and its MRAs from each repository:
